**Helldiver, high command has issued a special assignment: the revolting bugs, devious squids, and soulless bots have grown unacceptably quiet in select sectors. This silence is not peace - it is cowardice. YOU will remind them that Super Earth is eternal, vigilant, and armed. **

**Execute the assigned Operations with extreme prejudice. Deliver a message that No Planet is secure, No hiding place is sacred, that even their most secure planets aren't safe from the wraith of Managed Democracy.**

Each Operation is up to the Diver to interpret what planets and mission types High Command wants them to dive on.

Super Earth expects Helldivers undertaking Operations to have access to all their equipment as operating so deep behind enemy lines will make resupply of liberty's arms difficult. Logistics teams are currently disorganized and paperwork is backed up; we can't ensure you'll be getting what you order. Good luck!

*note: anyone playing this needs to have unlocked everything in the free warbond and all the stratagems you start the game having access to.
